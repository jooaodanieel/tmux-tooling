# TMUX Toolling repo

This repo stores the tooling to config and setup useful things for TMUX


## Setting Up

To run the setup, there' a bash script. Just run

```sh
bash setup.sh
```

This script will:
  1. copy the config file `.tmux.conf` to `~/.tmux.conf`
  2. copy the scripts in `./scripts` to `~/.local/bin` directory

> This configuration was inspired by the talk hosted here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7Dg1kmjhfQ
